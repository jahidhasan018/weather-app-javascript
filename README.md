## Overview

Welcome to the JavaScript Weather App project! This project is designed for practicing your skills in web development, specifically focusing on using JavaScript to create a weather application. The app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data for different locations around the world.

## Features

- **Weather Data:** Fetches current weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
- **Location Search:** Allows users to search for weather conditions in specific locations.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:** The core programming language for building the functionality of the weather app.
- **HTML and CSS:** Provide the structure and styling for the user interface.
- **OpenWeatherMap API:** Integrated to retrieve up-to-date weather information.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Obtain an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and replace the placeholder in the code with your key.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to run the weather app.
4. Enter the desired location in the search bar and explore real-time weather details.
